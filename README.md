# Graph-Clustering-and-Laplacian-Embeddings

Project Summary
This project demonstrates from-scratch implementations of several spectral graph clustering techniques (Fiedler’s method, maximum modularity, recursive partitioning) and Laplacian embeddings. Synthetic multi-cluster graphs are generated, partitioned, and then visualized in low-dimensional spaces, providing hands-on insight into the mechanics of spectral methods in Python.
